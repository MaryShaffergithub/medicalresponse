# TODO for AdhereR

  - *delete columns not used* (?) <-- not actually a problem: **FIXED!**
  
  - *more portable interactive plotting* -- try *shiny* (seems better than using python + R)  **DONE** (using Shiny)
  
  - *given vector of windows (i.e., not only uniformly sliding)*
  
  - *check running slave threads on different machine over the network*
  
  - *dates with no day specificed (i.e., only month & year)* -- probably assume 1st of the month?
  
  - *plotting bugs*: check carefully all sorts of plotting bugs (size, etc)
  
**Shiny interactive plots**:  *DONE*

  - plot size   **DONE**
  - force plot redrawing on resizing   **DONE**
  - save plot   *DONE*
  - when exiting, also attempt to close tab (?)   **DONT FIX** (not worth it)
