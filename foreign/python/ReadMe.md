# Calling `AdhereR` from `Python`

## Introduction

This is a reference implementation of a very general mechanism that allows `AdhereR` to be called transparently from other programming languages and platforms than `R`.
This reference implementation is for `Python 3`[^1] and does not aim to be efficient or very elegant, but to illustrate how `AdhereR` can be used in a transparent manner and to provide a basis for further implementations in other programming languages and for other statistical platforms (and even for more efficient approaches).

## Description of the mechanism





[^1]: It was developed and tested with `Python 3.6.5` on macOS 10.13 (High Sierra), but should be quite general.
